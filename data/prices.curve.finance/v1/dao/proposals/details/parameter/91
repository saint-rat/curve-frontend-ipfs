Preliminary analysis of data suggests that the newly launched USD Strategic Reserves does not eat into 3pool's flow significantly. It is thus worthile to experiment on increasing fee on larger flows, observing with real data the impact of this over a 3-month period, and assessing for future parameter optimisation strategies. Note that this proposal is complementary to the previous proposal to update 3pool: a raise in fees + a ramping of 3pool's amplification factor from 2000 to 4000 will increase flows meaningfully and supplement the DAO's bottom line, thereby helping liquid veCRV wrappers significantly.
